# ICIE URLs guide

ICIE uses URLs to identify tasks and contests.
If you want to train on an old task or a contest, you need to press <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>F11</kbd> and copy-paste it's web address (link, web address, browser address, URL, ...).
In case you have had bad luck and gotten a 'website link was not a valid URL' or 'website link was not recognized' error, here are some examples of good task/contest URLs to help you out:
