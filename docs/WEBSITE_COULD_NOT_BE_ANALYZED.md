# ICIE WCNBA bug report guide

First, thanks a lot for taking the time to report this!
These errors are a real pain to reproduce and often I don't really have a clue what happened, but are actually pretty easy to fix with a good error report.
So, please try to follow the instructions - but, if you have trouble with/don't want to do some step, just skip it :).
Some information is always better than none!

First, register and login to [GitHub], then **go to ICIE [issues page]**. 
Check if there already is an issue describing your problem and open it, or **press the green "New issue" button** if there isn't.
There, describe your problem, giving as much information from below as possible (the more I know, the easier it is to guess the reason):

1. Describe what were you trying to do.
    1. What were you trying to do? Submit a problem, open a contest, log in...?
    2. Which site were you using? Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder, SPOJ?
    3. A link to the contest/problem where the error happened.
    4. If you were taking part in a contest, were you registered for it?
    5. Which division are you? (this can matter on CodeChef and possibly other sites)
    6. Were you sending unusually many submits? (like 5 submits in 1 minute)
    7. Were there any errors before this error?
2. On the "ICIE Report" screen that opened, press **"page where the extension failed"**. This should open a web browser, displaying the web page ICIE was not able to analyze.
    1. **Please take and add screenshots of this page**, if possible. Try to show the important parts of the webpage, possibly you'll need to scroll a little.
    2. Alternatively, describe what can you see on the page. Is there some error message? Do you seem to be logged in?
    3. Do NOT send the entire page.html file (because of CSRF tokens).

Write all this as a comment or a new issue, and I'll try to respond really soon. **Be sure check the issue you created e.g. two days later, because I may ask for more details to help debug the problem!**

*Did you have any issues, or don't understand something? Please create an issue on the [issues page]!*
